            interface (UCI) April 2006</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The specification is independent of the operating system. For Windows, the engine is a normal exe file,
                either a console or "real" windows application.</li>
            <li>all communication is done via standard input and output with text commands,</li>
            <li>The engine should boot and wait for input from the GUI, the engine should wait for the "isready" or
                "setoption" command to set up its internal parameters as the boot process shou
                ld be as quick as possible.</li>
            <li>the engine must always be able to process input from stdin, even while thinking.</li>
            <li>all command strings the engine receives will end with ' <code>\n</code> ', also all commands the GUI
                receives should end with ' <code>\n</code> ', Note: ' <code>\n</code> ' can b
                e 0x0d or 0x0a0d or any combination depending on your OS. If you use Engine and GUI in the same OS this
                should be no problem if you communicate in text mode, but be aware of this whe
                n for example running a Linux engine in a Windows GUI.</li>
            <li>arbitrary white space between tokens is allowed Example: "debug on <code>\n</code> " and " debug on
                <code>\n</code> " and " <code>\t</code> debug <code>\t</code> <code>\t</code>
                <code>\t</code> on <code>\t</code> <code>\n</code> " all set the debug mode of the engine on.</li>
            <li>The engine will always be in forced mode which means it should never start calculating or pondering
                without receiving a "go" command first.</li>
            <li>Before the engine is asked to search on a position, there will always be a position command to tell the
                engine about the current position.</li>
            <li>by default all the opening book handling is done by the GUI, but there is an option for the engine to
                use its own book ("OwnBook" option, see below)</li>
            <li>if the engine or the GUI receives an unknown command or token it should just ignore it and try to parse
                the rest of the string in this line. Examples: "joho debug on <code>\n</code>
                " should switch the debug mode on given that joho is not defined, "debug joho on <code>\n</code> " will
                be
                undefined however.</li>
            <li>if the engine receives a command which is not supposed to come, for example "stop" when the engine is
                not calculating, it should also just ignore it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="move-format">Move format:</h2>
        <p>The move format is in long algebraic notation. A nullmove from the Engine to the GUI should be sent as 0000.
            Examples: e2e4, e7e5, e1g1 (white short castling), e7e8q (for promotio
            n)</p>
        <h2 id="gui-to-engine">GUI to engine:</h2>
        <p>These are all the command the engine gets from the interface.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>uci</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>tell engine to use the uci (universal chess interface), this will be sent once as a first
                            command after program boot to tell the engine to switch to uci mode. After receiving
                            the uci command the engine must identify itself with the "id" command and send the "option"
                            commands to tell the GUI which engine settings the engine supports if any. After that the
                            engine should send "uciok" to acknowledge the uci mode. If no uciok is sent within a certain
                            time period, the engine task will be killed by the GUI.</p>

                    <dd>
                        <p>switch the debug mode of the engine on and off. In debug mode the engine should send
                            additional infos to the GUI, e.g. with the "info string" command, to help debugging, e.g.
                            the commands that the engine has received etc. This mode should be switched off by default
                            and this command can be sent any time, also when the engine is thinking.</p>
                    </dd>

            </li>

                    <dt>isready</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>this is used to synchronize the engine with the GUI. When the GUI has sent a command or
                            multiple commands that can take some time to complete, this command can be used to wait
                            for the engine to be ready again or to ping the engine to find out if it is still alive.
                            E.g. this should be sent after setting the path to the tablebases as this can take some time
                            . This command is also required once before the engine is asked to do any search to wait for
                            the engine to finish initializing. This command must always be answered with "readyok" an
                            d can be sent also when the engine is calculating in which case the engine should also
                            immediately answer with "readyok" without stopping the search.</p>

                        <p>this is sent to the engine when the user wants to change the internal parameters of the
                            engine. For the "button" type no value is needed. One string will be sent for each para
                            meter and this will only be sent when the engine is waiting. The name and value of the
                            option in &lt;id&gt; should not be case sensitive and can inlude spaces. The substrings
                            "value"
                            and "name" should be avoided in &lt;id&gt; and &lt;x&gt; to allow unambiguous parsing, for
                            example do not use &lt;name&gt; = "draw value". Here are some strings for the example belo

                    <dd>this is the command to try to register an engine or to tell the engine that registration will be
                        done later. This command should always be sent if the engine has sent "registrati
                        on error" at program startup. The following tokens are allowed:

                        <p>this is sent to the engine when the next search (started with "position" and "go") will be
                            from a different game. This can be a new game the engine should play or a new game i
                            t should analyse but also the next position from a testsuite with positions only. If the GUI
                            hasn't sent a "ucinewgame" before the first "position" command, the engine shouldn't expe
                            ct any further ucinewgame commands as the GUI is probably not supporting the ucinewgame
                            command. So the engine should not rely on this command even though all new GUIs should
                            support
                            it. As the engine's reaction to "ucinewgame" can take some time the GUI should always send
                            "isready" after "ucinewgame" to wait for the engine to finish its operation.</p>

                            rtpos" will be sent Note: no "new" command is needed. However, if this position is from a
                            different game than the last position sent to the engine, the GUI should have sent a "ucinew
                            game" inbetween.</p>

                                            even if it's mate! This means that the last move sent in in the position
                                            string is the ponder move. T
                                            he engine can do what it wants to do, but after a "ponderhit" command it
                                            should execute the suggested move to ponder on. This means that the ponder
                                            move sent by the GUI can be interp
                                            reted as a recommendation about which move to ponder. However, if the engine
                                            decides to ponder on a different move, it should not display any mainlines
                                            as they are likely to be misin
                                            terpreted by the GUI because the GUI expects the engine to ponder on the
                                            suggested move.</p>

                        <p>this is needed for copyprotected engines. After the uciok command the engine can tell the
                            GUI, that it will check the copy protection now. This is done by "copyprotection chec
                            king". If the check is ok the engine should send "copyprotection ok", otherwise
                            "copyprotection error". If there is an error the engine should not function properly but
                            should not qu
                            it alone. If the engine reports "copyprotection error" the GUI should not use this engine
                            and display an error message instead! The code in the engine can look like this TellGUI("cop
                            yprotection checking <code>\n</code> "); // ... check the copy protection here ... if(ok)
                            TellGUI("copyprotection ok <code>\n</code> "); else TellGUI("copyprotection error

                            Analog to the "copyprotection" command the engine can send "registration checking"
                            after the uciok command followed by either "registration ok" or "registration error". Also
                            after every attempt to register the engine it should answer with "registration checking" a
                            nd then either "registration ok" or "registration error". In contrast to the
                            "copyprotection" command, the GUI can use the engine after the engine has reported an error,
                            but should i
                            nform the user that the engine is not properly registered and might not use all its
                            features. In addition the GUI should offer to open a dialog to enable registration of the
                            engine.
                            To try to register an engine the GUI can send the "register" command. The GUI has to always
                            answer with the "register" command if the engine sends "registration error" at engine star
                            tup (this can also be done with "register later") and tell the user somehow that the engine
                            is not registered. This way the engine knows that the GUI can deal with the registration p
                            rocedure and the user will be informed that the engine is not properly registered.</p>

                    <dt>info</dt>
                    <dd>the engine wants to send information to the GUI. This should be done whenever one of the info
                        has changed. The engine can send only selected infos or multiple infos with one info
                        command, e.g. "info currmove e2e4 currmovenumber 1" or "info depth 12 nodes 123456 nps 100000".
                        Also all infos belonging to the pv should be sent together e.g. "info depth 2 score c
                        p 214 time 1242 nodes 2124 nps 34928 pv e2e4 e7e5 g1f3" I suggest to start sending "currmove",
                        "currmovenumber", "currline" and "refutation" only after one second to avoid too much t
                        raffic. Additional info:

                                        it should just ignore it and not display it in the engine's options dialog.
